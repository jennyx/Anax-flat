BTS - MIC DROP

Yeah, who says my spoon is dirty?
I don’t care, when I grab the mic, I have several gold spoons
Several uncooked steaks over there make me mad
Once again, I’ll chew you all up, on the night of the stars

Center of World Business
1st on the recruitment list, sold out
This class is not common, enjoy this value
Bad odors with good scents are against the rules
Mic mic bungee

Mic mic bungee
Bright lights, going forward
You thought I was gonna fail but I’m fine, sorry
Sorry, Billboard
Sorry, worldwide
Sorry mom, your son’s too hot
I’m being a good son in place of you
No cons in our concerts
I do it, I do it, you’re a bad ratatouille
If you’re jealous, sue me
Sue it

Did you see my bag
Did you see my bag
My bag’s filled with trophies
How you think bout that
How you think bout that
Haters are already giving up

My success is already so golden
I’m so firin’ firin’ like a torchbearer
You’re rushing to run away
How you dare
How you dare
How you dare

So many trophies in my hands
Too heavy, my hands aren’t enough
Mic drop
Mic drop
Careful of your feet
Careful of what you say

Lodi dodi, I’m so busy
Too busy, my one body isn’t enough
Mic drop
Mic drop
Careful of your feet
Careful of what you say

This is the the exact saying
Right will prevail in the end
Once upon a time
Aesop’s Fables, fly
Look at your reality, too bad
Even if I die now, I’m damn happy
Which country are we going to this time?
Spending hours on a plane
Yeah I’m on the mountain
Yeah I’m on the bay
Total exhaustion on the stage
Mic drop bam

Did you see my bag
Did you see my bag
My bag’s filled with trophies
How you think bout that
How you think bout that
Haters are already giving up

My success is already so golden
I’m so firin’ firin’ like a torchbearer
You’re rushing to run away
How you dare
How you dare
How you dare

So many trophies in my hands
Too heavy, my hands aren’t enough
Mic drop
Mic drop
Careful of your feet
Careful of what you say

Lodi dodi, I’m so busy
Too busy, my one body isn’t enough
Mic drop
Mic drop
Careful of your feet
Careful of what you say

Haters gon’ hate
Players gon’ play
Live a life. man
Good luck

No need to see each other ever again, this is my last goodbye
Nothing more left to say, don’t even apologize
No need to see each other ever again, this is my last goodbye
Nothing more left to say, don’t even apologize

Look closely, look at your pathetic self
We shoot up just like coca cola
Your corneas will be so shocked
Cause we’re just so cool

SUNMI - GASHINA

Your cold eyes
They kill me
The fire in your heart that used to grow
Why are there only ashes remaining?
Maybe time is medicine
But I’m getting weaker
The sad pain
is getting numb too

Fine, I’ll forget you
I’m gonna live like a flower, I’ll be myself
Can’t nobody stop me now
No try me

Everyone wants my scent
But only you don’t know, like a fool
Are you sure you’re not crazy?

Why are you leaving the pretty me here
And going?

You’re leaving me here
You’re leaving me so easily
You promised we’d go together
But you’re leaving, leaving

You’ll see me all sharp
And you’ll bow your head low
My thorns will
dig deeper in you, yeah
You already bent and twisted me
So don’t act like you’re sorry
But the one who’s really twisted
It’s not me, it’s you

Fine, I’ll forget you
I’m gonna live like a flower, I’ll be myself
Can’t nobody stop me now
No try me

Everyone wants my scent
But only you don’t know, like a fool
Are you sure you’re not crazy?

Why are you leaving the pretty me here
And going?

You’re leaving me here
You’re leaving me so easily
You promised we’d go together
But you’re leaving, leaving

You have withered, I have bloomed
And it’s over
Even if you wanna come back
You may seem like you’ll be fine
without me right now
But no matter how much I think about it
Are you sure you’re not crazy?

Why are you leaving the pretty me here
And going?

You’re leaving me here
You’re leaving me so easily
You promised we’d go together
But you’re leaving, leaving
